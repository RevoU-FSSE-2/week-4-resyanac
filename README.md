   You can select your plan after that follow the given steps. change the nameserver on niaga hoster with Cloudflare's nameservers. It may take few hours    to be activated. Cloudflare will give you notification on email that your site is set up.

   <li>The last step</li>
   If your domain is active you can back to https://netlify.com/. Afterward, add record on DNS RECORD. In this case i use CNAME because i already deploy my web on netlify. Dont forget to add record the <i>www</i>.
